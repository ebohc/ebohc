## 🧠 About Me

I'm an **Information Security and GRC Specialist** with over a decade of experience leading security programs, enforcing regulatory compliance, and driving risk-informed decision-making across enterprise environments.

I bring a hybrid skill set that combines technical security operations and strategic GRC leadership — enabling organizations to secure systems, reduce risk, and maintain audit-ready compliance across frameworks including **ISO 27001**, **SOC 2**, **NIST CSF**, **HIPAA**, **SOX**, **PCI DSS 4.0**, **ISO 22301**, and **ISO 20000**.

## 🛡️ What I Deliver

### 🔐 Security Operations & Threat Response
- Collaborated with SOC teams on security incident triage, fine-tuning Sentinel detection rules, and threat hunting via Cortex XDR, Varonis, and Defender 365.
- Developed playbooks and escalation workflows for phishing, malware, and unauthorized access — integrating automation in **Jira Service Management** to reduce MTTD and MTTR.
- Example project: [Security Incident Playbooks Template](https://github.com/ebohc/security-playbooks)

### ⚙️ Risk Management & Remediation
- Led rollout of a vulnerability management SLA framework based on **NIST SP 800-40**, reducing MTTR by 87% in 24 months.
- Integrated Jira dashboards and real-time tracking for visibility across GRC and DevOps teams.
- Example project: [Vulnerability SLA Framework](https://github.com/ebohc/vuln-sla-template)

### 📊 Compliance & Audit Readiness
- Spearheaded evidence gathering for:
  - SOC 2 Type II
  - HIPAA Security Rule
  - SOX ITGC Controls
  - PCI DSS 4.0 & ISO 27001
- Automated control monitoring using **Drata**, **OneTrust**, and **SharePoint**, improving policy acknowledgments and audit prep.

### 📘 Policy & Governance Programs
- Authored policies covering: Incident Response, AI Security, Vendor Risk, Business Continuity (ISO 22301), Acceptable Use, and Access Control.
- Created ISO-aligned **risk registers**, RACI matrices, and control mapping documents.
- Example project: [InfoSec Policy Starter Kit](https://github.com/ebohc/security-policies) 

### 🤖 AI & Data Governance
- Developed AI Security Policy covering risk scoring, vendor usage controls, and ethical safeguards.
- Evaluated generative tools for HIPAA/SOC 2 compliance risks and model bias safeguards.

> *Security should be enforceable and explainable.*  
>  I help organizations secure systems, reduce risk, and meet regulatory expectations by delivering security that is measurable, scalable, and audit-ready. Driven by the belief that security must be both enforceable and explainable, I build scalable, auditable, and metrics-driven programs that empower smarter decisions across people, processes, and technology.
