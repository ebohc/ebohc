# About Me

I'm an Information Security and Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) Specialist with over a decade of experience leading security programs, enforcing regulatory compliance, and driving risk-informed decision-making across enterprise environments.

I bring a hybrid skill set that combines technical security expertise with deep GRC domain knowledge — enabling organizations to build secure architectures while maintaining audit-ready compliance with global and U.S. standards such as **ISO 27001**, **SOC 2**, **PCI DSS**, **NIST CSF**, **HIPAA**, **SOX**, **ISO 22301**, and **ISO 20000**.

Based in Canada

## 🛡️ What I Deliver

### 🔐 Security Operations & Threat Response
- Collaborated alongside SOC teams to triage security incidents, fine-tune SIEM rules (Microsoft Sentinel), and support threat hunting initiatives using Cortex XDR, Varonis, and Defender 365.
- Developed escalation workflows and playbooks to streamline detection and response across phishing, malware, and access-related incidents. This included triage procedures for alerts from Microsoft Sentinel, Cortex XDR, and Defender 365; phishing response guides using PhishER; containment protocols for account compromise and endpoint isolation; and automated escalation paths integrated into Jira Service Management. These playbooks improved coordination between SOC, IT, and DevOps teams, significantly reducing MTTD and MTTR across the board.

### ⚙️ Risk Management & Remediation
- Led the design of a unified vulnerability management SLA framework based on NIST SP 800-40, achieving a significant reduction in MTTR (87% in 24 months).
- Integrated remediation tracking into Jira Service Management and delivered real-time risk dashboards for management oversight.

### 📊 Compliance & Audit Readiness
- Spearheaded internal readiness and evidence mapping for external audits including:
  - SOC 2 Type II
  - HIPAA Security Rule compliance
  - SOX ITGC reviews
  - PCI DSS 4.0 and ISO 27001 certification cycles
- Automated GRC workflows with tools like **Drata**, **OneTrust**, and **SharePoint**, improving control tracking and policy acknowledgment rates.

### 🧩 Policy Development & Governance
- Developed and implemented security policies covering **Incident Response**, **AI Security**, **Business Continuity (ISO 22301)**, **Vendor Risk**, and **Acceptable Use**.
- Designed enterprise risk registers, RACI maps, and control matrices tied to ISO 27001 Annex A, NIST 800-53, and PCI DSS 4.0.

### 🤖 AI & Data Governance
- Developed an organizational AI Security Policy governing model risk, ethical AI principles, and vendor assessment of generative tools.
- Evaluated AI solutions for security gaps and data residency risks — especially where HIPAA, PII, or SOC 2 implications were involved.

> I help organizations secure systems, reduce risk, and meet regulatory expectations — delivering security that is measurable, scalable, and audit-ready. I am driven by the belief that security should be both enforceable and explainable. My goal is to build scalable programs that reduce risk, meet compliance, and provide visibility to decision-makers.
