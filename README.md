# 👋 Hi, I'm Chidiebere Eboh

## 🔐 Information Security & GRC Professional | Transitioning into more Vulnerability Management & Technical Security Roles

I'm a passionate and results-driven security professional with a decade of hands-on experience in Information Security, Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC). I’ve led enterprise policy initiatives, security audits, and vendor risk assessments across global environments—ensuring compliance with leading standards such as **ISO 27001**, **SOC 2**, **NIST**, and **PCI DSS**.

Currently pivoting into more technical roles where I can apply my deep compliance knowledge alongside technical capabilities in:

- **Vulnerability Assessment & Management**
- **Security Engineering**
- **Incident Response Playbooks & Automation**
- **Secure CI/CD and Code Analysis Tools (SonarQube, GitHub Copilot)**

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Security Tools:** Nessus, OpenVAS, SonarQube, Drata, Qualys, Burp Suite, Crowd Strike
- **DevOps & Cloud:** GitHub Actions, Docker, Jenkins, Rancher  
- **Compliance:** ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, SOC 2, PCI DSS  
- **Documentation & Processes:** Confluence, Jira, Markdown, Excel (metrics dashboards)

## 📌 Featured Projects (In Progress)

Here’s a preview of what I’m currently building or preparing to upload — all tailored to reflect real-world GRC and technical security experience:

- 🛡️ **Vulnerability Assessment Lab**  
  Set up a vulnerable environment using Metasploitable/Kali and scan it using Nessus/OpenVAS. Includes sample findings, remediation steps, and reporting.

- 📊 **Security Metrics Dashboard**  
  Python-automated KPI dashboard tracking vulnerability SLAs, incident metrics, phishing campaign results, and training completion.

- 🧾 **Vendor Risk Assessment Toolkit**  
  A collection of my Excel-based vendor risk templates, with mock vendor reviews (e.g., GitHub Copilot, SonarQube). Includes criticality scoring, justification, and recommendations.

- 🔄 **DevSecOps Pipeline Demo**  
  CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions with integrated static code analysis (SAST), secret scanning, and dependency checks.

- 📝 **Policy & SOP Repository**  
  Redacted templates of real-world policies aligned to ISO/NIST frameworks (e.g., AI Security Policy, Acceptable Use, Mobile Device Management, Vulnerability Mgmt.).

Each project will reflect my ability to bridge security governance and technical implementation.
