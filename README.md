## 📌 Featured Projects (In Progress)

Here’s what I’m building to showcase my GRC and security experience in practical ways:

- 🛡️ **Vulnerability Assessment Lab**  
  A sample scanning lab using Nessus/OpenVAS against test environments. Includes findings, risk ratings, and remediation workflows.

- 📊 **Security Metrics Dashboard**  
  Excel/Python-based KPI tracking (e.g., incidents, SLAs, phishing scores, and training completion) for quarterly reporting.

- 🧾 **Vendor Risk Assessment Toolkit**  
  Includes redacted templates and mock assessments (e.g., SonarQube, GitHub Copilot) with scoring, justifications, and risk ratings.

- 📝 **Policy & SOP Repository**  
  ISO/NIST-aligned templates and redacted policy examples: Acceptable Use, Vulnerability Mgmt., Mobile Devices, AI Security.

Each project highlights my ability to blend security governance with real-world assessments and documentation.
