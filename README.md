# 👋 Hi, I'm Chidie Eboh

## 🔐 Information Security & GRC Professional | Transitioning into Vulnerability Management & Technical Security Roles

I'm a passionate and results-driven security professional with 3+ years of hands-on experience in Information Security, Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC). I’ve led enterprise policy initiatives, security audits, and vendor risk assessments across global environments—ensuring compliance with leading standards such as **ISO 27001**, **SOC 2**, **NIST**, and **PCI DSS**.

Currently transitioning into more technical roles where I can apply my deep compliance knowledge alongside technical capabilities in:

## 🔐 Professional Focus Areas

- **Vulnerability Assessment & Management**  
  Performing vulnerability scans using tools like Nessus and OpenVAS, analyzing findings, and supporting remediation efforts based on risk severity and SLAs.

- **Security Monitoring & Incident Response**  
  Supporting incident investigations, developing playbooks, and aligning response workflows with organizational SLAs and regulatory expectations.

- **Secure Code Analysis & Risk Reviews**  
  Reviewing security implications of code and development practices, including usage of tools like SonarQube, GitHub Copilot, and other AI-assisted coding tools.

- **Policy Development & Framework Alignment (ISO/NIST)**  
  Writing and managing security policies and procedures aligned to ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, SOC 2, and PCI DSS frameworks.

- **Risk Management According to ISO 27005 & NIST 800-30**  
  Identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks in accordance with structured methodologies and organizational risk registers.

- **Security Awareness & Insider Threat Program Development**  
  Designing training campaigns and preventive controls to reduce human risk, improve security behavior, and monitor for insider threat indicators.

- **Third-Party/Vendor Security Assessments & Criticality Scoring**  
  Conducting structured vendor reviews, evaluating data sensitivity, operational dependency, and assigning criticality scores with justification and control recommendations.

- **Security Metrics & Reporting for Executive Stakeholders**  
  Developing dashboards and reports that visualize security KPIs such as vulnerability closure rates, incident resolution time, compliance gaps, and SLA adherence for leadership and audit teams.

## 📌 Featured Projects (In Progress)

Here’s what I’m building to showcase my GRC and security experience in practical ways:

- 🛡️ **Vulnerability Assessment Lab**  
  A sample scanning lab using Nessus/OpenVAS against test environments. Includes findings, risk ratings, and remediation workflows.

- 📊 **Security Metrics Dashboard**  
  Excel/Python-based KPI tracking (e.g., incidents, SLAs, phishing scores, and training completion) for quarterly reporting.

- 🧾 **Vendor Risk Assessment Toolkit**  
  Includes redacted templates and mock assessments (e.g., SonarQube, GitHub Copilot) with scoring, justifications, and risk ratings.

- 📝 **Policy & SOP Repository**  
  ISO/NIST-aligned templates and redacted policy examples: Acceptable Use, Vulnerability Mgmt., Mobile Devices, AI Security.

Each project highlights my ability to blend security governance with real-world assessments and documentation.
